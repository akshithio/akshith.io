Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks rely on the ability for computers to understand
human language and the true meanings associated with each word. Algorithms that are able
to capture the nuance of these words via numeric representations are referred to as word
embedding algorithms.

# Oops Heading Time

So that’s it my friends I am done let’s think aboiut this being some sort of conclusion paragraph because i don’t know how this really work and all that stuff but yes very cool, i had very much fun making this and all that because yotu know stuff and all happens and stuff and cool stuff.

```python
import requests

# The URL for the API endpoint you want to fetch data fromurl = 'https://api.example.com/data'# Perform a GET requestresponse = requests.get(url)# Check if the request was successfulif response.status_code == 200:    # Parse the JSON response    data = response.json()    print(data)else:    print(f'Failed to fetch data: HTTP {response.status_code}')
```
