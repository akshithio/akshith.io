Hello, World!

Much of what you're seeing on your screen right now has been built from _semi-scratch_ to be as modular, convenient and dynamic as possible. This should allow me to hopefully write more often and reduce the friction between that first draft and commit button. In what follows, I outline some of what was used to build much of my website, focusing specifically on the writing section and demonstrating what has been built so far.

I've relied primarily on `@mdxjs` alongside a collection of growing custom components, that I would like to quickly demonstrate down below.

### Custom Components

Since, these are all markdown files there is support for the standard `<h1>` through `<h6>` heading structure (like seen above), italics, bolding and more right out of the box.

<ImageComp
  src="https://v9qoelznu6.ufs.sh/f/KqS0F7xRrUGcoX1nVypR6swX3E0LJAGDU42gZ8Ti1hWtKQ9x"
  width={800}
  height={578.439964938}
  alt="test image"
  creds="https://akshith.io"
  description="Not much to see here except a messy Figma. Simple Image Component"
  num={1}
/>

<SideNoteComp
  num={1}
  description="I can ramble here about other things not related to what I'm actually talking about. Helpful because I can't stop talking!"
/>

After the image there's this way for me to leave side-notes <SideCitationComp>[@1]</SideCitationComp>, in case I need to add additional detail that isn't directly relevant to what I'm talking about. I can also cite other more extensive sources like this <CitationSuperscriptComp>1</CitationSuperscriptComp> so that you can click on them and be taken to the bottom of this page with more details about why I said what I said. There are also ways for me to cite some interesting resources in-text like this really cool paper for example.

<InTextCitationComp
  type="paper"
  link="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762"
  name="Attention is all you need"
  authors="Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit, Llion Jones, Aidan N. Gomez, Lukasz Kaiser, Illia Polosukhin"
/>

Alternatively, if I'm feeling oddly philosophical or find myself in need of some expert "ethos" to make my argument stand out, I can choose to simply include a quote using the **>** character followed by what I want to say as shown below.

> A wiseman once said something about doing something but I don't know what he said. Also this sidebar glows for some reason and I like that it glows. **~ Akshith Garapati**

Or if I feel like laying out a series of simple bullet points i can do that too,

- this is **exhbit a**
- this would be **exhibit b**

There is support for LaTeX math, meaning this would be the pythagorean theorem: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$, **\#quickmaths** and there is also support for syntax highlighting and neat code snippets like the one shown below:

```tsx
import ImageComp from "@/components/blog/standard/ImageComp";
import InTextCitationComp from "@/components/blog/standard/InTextCitationComp";
import SideCitationComp from "@/components/blog/standard/SideCitationComp";
import SideNoteComp from "@/components/blog/standard/SideNoteComp";

import { passenger } from "./fonts";

const MarkdownComponents = {
  h1: (props: any) => (
    <h1 className=" my-6 text-4xl md:text-5xl dark:text-aWhite" {...props} />
  ),
  h2: (props: any) => (
    <h2 className=" my-5 text-3xl md:text-4xl dark:text-aWhite" {...props} />
  ),
  h3: (props: any) => (
    <h3 className=" my-4 text-2xl md:text-3xl dark:text-aWhite" {...props} />
  ),
  h4: (props: any) => (
    <h4 className=" my-3 text-xl md:text-2xl dark:text-aWhite" {...props} />
  ),
  h5: (props: any) => (
    <h5 className=" my-2 text-lg md:text-xl dark:text-aWhite" {...props} />
  ),
  h6: (props: any) => (
    <h6 className=" my-2 text-base md:text-lg dark:text-aWhite" {...props} />
  ),
```
