# akshith.io

ðŸ”¨: You can run it by simply cloning, running `pnpm i` followed by `pnpm dev` and visiting `localhost:3000`. You will also need to create a `.env` and fill in the environment variables listed in `.env.example` for all functionality to work as expected. Built with Next, Tailwind & Typescript.

`akshith.io` is my personal website. Much of the work on the website was spent primarily on the writing section of the website which relies on the `.mdx` files available in the `content` folder. If necessary, this system alongside the set of custom components can be succesfully adapted for alternative projects. Other aspects of the website remain primarily visual, with little external utility outside of this project.

This website implicitly relies on my CLI tool [`adot`](https://github.com/akshithio/akshith.io) for the `<LocationStatus>` component to work as expected alongside the microblogging section on the `/writing` route. The project structure is as follows:

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/                   # Next.js app directory
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ writing/           # Writing section routes
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ page.tsx           # Home page
â”œâ”€â”€ components/            # React components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layout/            # Layout components (Navbar, Tooltip, etc.)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/             # Page-specific components
â”œâ”€â”€ content/               # MDX content for blog posts
